# Greetings, fellow humans!  


Call me redbrain.   

I (he/him) commonly refer to this as my graveyard of potential projects and/or library of temporarily patched dependencies. Feel free to look around!   

I code as a hobby but could potentially code professionally if I ever become a real adult.   

I'm fluent in Node.js, web development (HTML/CSS/JS), and Python, but I've used a bit of too many languages to count.   

Submit an issue in redbrain/redbrain if you need to talk to me for some reason.   

You can shortlink to this page with [git.io/redbrain](https://git.io/redbrain).   

Until next time, keep imagining!

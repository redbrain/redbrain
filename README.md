# Greetings, fellow humans!  


Call me **redbrain**. (This screenname predates time and space; it does not define any religious alignment.)  

I (he/him) commonly refer to this as my graveyard of potential projects and/or library of temporarily patched dependencies. Feel free to look around!  

I code as a hobby but could potentially code professionally if I ever become a real adult.  

I'm fluent in Node.js, the interweb (HTML/CSS/JS), and Python, but I've used countless languages at least once for some purpose.  

I'm working on a web app called Resonance for collaborative music editing, along with [plenty more](https://redbrain.github.io).

Emails are junky and boring. If you'd like to talk to me quickly, consider submitting an issue in redbrain/redbrain.  

You can shortlink to this page with [git.io/redbrain](https://git.io/redbrain).  

Until next time, keep imagining!

## Salutations lifeform!  


Call me redbrain.   

I (he/him) commonly refer to this as my graveyard of potential projects. Feel free to look around!   

I code as a hobby but could potentially code professionally if I ever become a real adult.   

I'm working in Python, HTML, Node.JS, PHP, Bash, and a little bit of a ton of other languages.   

Submit an issue in this repo if you need to talk to me for some reason.   

You can shortlink to this page with https://git.io/redbrain .   

Until next time, happy coding!

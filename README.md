Call me redbrain.  
I (he/him) commonly refer to this as my graveyard of potential projects. Feel free to look around!  
I code as a hobby but could potentially code professionally if i ever become a real adult.  
I'm working in Python, HTML, Node.JS, PHP, Bash, and a little bit of a ton of others.  
Submit an issue in this repo of you need to talk to me for some reason.  
You can shortlink to this page with https://git.io/redbrain .  
Until next time!
